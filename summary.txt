Current Reality Check:
Current Implementation: 147 commands (29% complete)
Target for Complete PyTorch Coverage: ~497 commands
Missing Functionality: 350+ commands across 15 major categories
Major Missing Areas:
Mathematical Operations: 180+ missing functions (trigonometric, exponential, logical, comparison, reduction operations)
Neural Network Layers: 85+ missing layers (extended convolutions, pooling, activations, normalization, transformers, embeddings, padding)
Vision Operations: 30+ missing functions (completely absent - pixel shuffle, interpolation, ROI operations, etc.)
Signal Processing: 20+ missing extensions (2D FFT, windows, spectrograms, MFCC, etc.)
Linear Algebra: 25+ missing operations (cross product, matrix decompositions, norms, etc.)
Quantization: 20+ missing functions (completely absent - critical for deployment)
Advanced Loss Functions: 20+ missing (specialized losses for different domains)
Implementation Roadmap:
The document provides a 5-phase implementation plan spanning 14-19 months:
Phase 1 (P0): Core Mathematical Foundation - 50 commands
Phase 2 (P0): Essential Deep Learning - 60 commands
Phase 3 (P1): Advanced Neural Networks - 80 commands
Phase 4 (P2): Specialized Operations - 100 commands
Phase 5 (P3): Advanced Features - 60 commands
You were absolutely right to question the 147 command count. For a library claiming "world-class tensor computing" and "complete PyTorch functionality," we're actually only about 29% complete. The remaining 71% represents substantial work across mathematical operations, neural network components, computer vision, signal processing, and specialized domains that are essential for a truly comprehensive tensor computing environment.
