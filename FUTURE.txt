Immediate Recommendations:
High Priority (Greatest Impact):
TorchScript support - Essential for production deployment
ONNX export/import - Critical for interoperability
Data loading infrastructure - Fundamental for training workflows
Medium Priority (High Value):
Computer vision transforms - Very commonly needed
Model hub integration - Greatly improves usability
Advanced optimizers and schedulers - Important for research
Lower Priority (Nice to Have):
Audio/NLP specific utilities - Domain-specific but valuable
Advanced debugging tools - Helpful for development
Deployment utilities - Important for production
Your project already covers the core tensor operations, neural network layers, training basics, and many advanced features excellently. Adding TorchScript, ONNX support, and data loading would make it significantly more complete and production-ready. The computer vision transforms would also be very valuable since image processing is such a common use case.
Would you like me to help implement any of these features, starting with the highest priority ones?


Summary by Command Count:
Data Loading Infrastructure: ~25-30 commands
Advanced Training Features: ~18-22 commands
Computer Vision Transforms: ~20-25 commands
TorchScript/JIT: ~15-20 commands
Text/NLP Processing: ~15-20 commands
Audio Processing: ~12-15 commands
Debugging & Profiling: ~12-15 commands
ONNX Import/Export: ~8-12 commands
Model Hub: ~10-15 commands
Deployment Features: ~8-12 commands
Total potential additional commands: ~143-186 commands
This would roughly double or triple the size of your current command set, but you could implement them incrementally based on priority and use cases. The data loading infrastructure alone would add significant value with its ~25-30 commands.

‚ùå Would Require Additional Libraries
1. Computer Vision - Advanced Transforms (20-30 commands)

Basic transforms (resize, crop, normalize) are in LibTorch
Advanced operations (perspective transforms, morphological ops) need OpenCV
2. Audio Processing (40-60 commands)

libsndfile for audio I/O
FFmpeg for format support
SoX for signal processing
LibTorch has no built-in audio support
3. Text/NLP (30-50 commands)
‚ùå Needs tokenization libraries:
SentencePiece for subword tokenization

üìä Summary by Effort
High Priority - Already Available (165-245 commands)
TorchScript/JIT: 40 commands - Just implement the C++/Tcl bindings
Advanced Training: 60 commands - Extend existing implementations
ONNX: 25 commands - ONNX libraries already linked
Advanced Tensors: 80 commands - All in LibTorch core
Medium Priority - Needs External Libraries (140-190 commands)
Computer Vision: 30 commands - Requires OpenCV
Audio: 60 commands - Requires multiple audio libraries
Text/NLP: 50 commands - Requires tokenization libraries
Advanced Data Loading: 25 commands - Requires format libraries
Model Hub: 15 commands - Requires network libraries
üîß Recommendation
Start with the "Already Available" features (165-245 commands) since they require no additional dependencies:
TorchScript/JIT - Biggest bang for buck, widely used
Complete ONNX support - ONNX is already compiled in
Advanced tensor operations - Extend your existing strong foundation
Enhanced training features - Build on what you have
For external dependencies, Computer Vision with OpenCV would be the most practical addition since:
OpenCV is widely available and well-documented
Adds significant functionality (30 commands)
Commonly used in ML pipelines
The audio and NLP features would require more complex dependency management and multiple libraries.
