# LibTorch User Guide

## Introduction
LibTorch is the C++ version of PyTorch, designed for high-performance, low-latency applications. It provides tensor computation and deep learning tools, making it ideal for production environments, research, and embedded systems.

## Core Features
1. **Tensor Operations**: Basic and advanced math operations on multi-dimensional arrays.
2. **Neural Networks**: Pre-built layers and tools for building custom models.
3. **TorchScript**: Compile models for deployment without Python.
4. **ONNX Support**: Export and import models for interoperability with other frameworks.
5. **Training Utilities**: Optimizers, loss functions, and data loading tools.

## Command Groups
### 1. Tensor Operations
- Creation: `torch::tensor`, `torch::zeros`, `torch::ones`
- Math: `torch::add`, `torch::mul`, `torch::matmul`
- Manipulation: `torch::reshape`, `torch::transpose`, `torch::cat`

### 2. Neural Networks
- Layers: `torch::nn::Linear`, `torch::nn::Conv2d`, `torch::nn::LSTM`
- Activation Functions: `torch::nn::ReLU`, `torch::nn::Sigmoid`
- Loss Functions: `torch::nn::MSELoss`, `torch::nn::CrossEntropyLoss`

### 3. TorchScript
- Model Scripting: `torch::jit::script`
- Saving/Loading: `torch::jit::save`, `torch::jit::load`

### 4. Data Loading
- Datasets: Custom dataset classes for loading data.
- Transforms: Preprocessing pipelines for images, text, etc.

## Example Workflows
### Image Classification
1. Load a pre-trained model.
2. Preprocess input images.
3. Run inference.

### Training a Model
1. Define a neural network.
2. Load training data.
3. Train using an optimizer and loss function.

## Advanced Topics
- **Deployment**: Compile models for mobile or server environments.
- **Performance Tuning**: Use profiling tools to optimize speed and memory.

## Next Steps
- Explore the `examples/` directory for project templates.
- Refer to the API documentation for detailed function descriptions.
