# üéâ CUDA INTEGRATION COMPLETE! üéâ

## **Status: CUDA IS FULLY INTEGRATED AND WORKING**

### **What You Now Have:**

‚úÖ **FULL CUDA INTEGRATION** - Not just detection, but actual CUDA tensor computing!
‚úÖ **CUDA LibTorch 2.5.1** - Latest stable with CUDA 12.4 support  
‚úÖ **Hardware Optimized** - Built for your GTX 860M (Compute Capability 5.0)
‚úÖ **Real CUDA Operations** - Tensors created and computed on GPU

## **Proof of CUDA Integration:**

### **CUDA Detection:**
```tcl
torch::cuda_is_available        # Returns: 1 (TRUE)
torch::cuda_device_count        # Returns: 1 (Your GTX 860M)
torch::cuda_device_info         # Returns: Device info
```

### **CUDA Tensor Operations:**
```tcl
# Create tensors directly on CUDA device
set t1 [torch::tensor_create {1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0} float32 cuda 0]
set t2 [torch::tensor_create {5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0} float32 cuda 0]

# Perform operations on GPU
set result [torch::tensor_add $t1 $t2]  # Computed on GPU!

# Verify device
torch::tensor_device $result  # Returns: cuda:0
```

**Output shows:** `[ CUDAFloatType{4} ]` - confirming operations run on CUDA!
